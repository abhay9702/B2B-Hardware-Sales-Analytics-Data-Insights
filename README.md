### 📊 **Project Motivation & Why It Was Executed**

This project was created to help **B2B Hardware**, a company that supplies computer hardware and peripherals across India, gain meaningful insights from its sales data. The **Sales Director was facing significant challenges** in understanding how the business was performing because the existing reporting was manual, inconsistent, and mostly verbal. Regional managers would verbally report quarterly figures without reliable data, which made it difficult to accurately track sales trends or understand why revenue was declining.

As sales were **declining in a dynamically growing market**, the leadership lacked a clear, data-driven view of performance, regional growth, customer patterns, or product contributions. The absence of a central tool meant that **decisions were being made based on intuition or fragmented information**, rather than real insights derived from the actual sales data. 

### 🧠 **Problem Statement & Company Understanding**

B2B Hardware has its head office in Delhi and several regional offices throughout India. The company struggled with:

* Lack of **automated analysis or real-time sales reporting**
* Dependency on **manual reports and verbal insights** from regional managers
* No way to **track performance trends** across regions, customers, or time periods
* Inability to make **data-backed decisions to improve sales and profitability** 

The core issue was not the absence of data — it was the inability to **extract meaningful insights from that data efficiently**. The solution needed to enable quick analysis, uncover hidden performance gaps, and help leadership visualize trends and patterns for better decision-making.
