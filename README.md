### 📊 **Project Motivation & Why It Was Executed**

This project was created to help **B2B Hardware**, a company that supplies computer hardware and peripherals across India, gain meaningful insights from its sales data. The **Sales Director was facing significant challenges** in understanding how the business was performing because the existing reporting was manual, inconsistent, and mostly verbal. Regional managers would verbally report quarterly figures without reliable data, which made it difficult to accurately track sales trends or understand why revenue was declining.

As sales were **declining in a dynamically growing market**, the leadership lacked a clear, data-driven view of performance, regional growth, customer patterns, or product contributions. The absence of a central tool meant that **decisions were being made based on intuition or fragmented information**, rather than real insights derived from the actual sales data. 

### 🧠 **Problem Statement & Company Understanding**

B2B Hardware has its head office in Delhi and several regional offices throughout India. The company struggled with:

* Lack of **automated analysis or real-time sales reporting**
* Dependency on **manual reports and verbal insights** from regional managers
* No way to **track performance trends** across regions, customers, or time periods
* Inability to make **data-backed decisions to improve sales and profitability** 

The core issue was not the absence of data — it was the inability to **extract meaningful insights from that data efficiently**. The solution needed to enable quick analysis, uncover hidden performance gaps, and help leadership visualize trends and patterns for better decision-making.

**1️⃣ Key Insights Dashboard**

**What’s happening:**
This page provides a high-level snapshot of overall business performance across regions, customers, and products. It highlights total revenue, quantity sold, profit margin, and contribution %, along with YoY and MoM trends. At a glance, stakeholders can identify whether the business is growing, stagnating, or declining and which regions or segments are driving results.

**Why it’s happening:**
Sales performance varies due to seasonality, regional demand differences, customer concentration, and product mix. Without consolidated insights, leadership often relies on fragmented reports, making it difficult to quickly spot trends or anomalies.

**How the dashboard helps:**
The Key Insights page acts as a single source of truth. Interactive filters allow users to drill down by region, customer, or product to identify growth drivers and underperforming areas. YoY and MoM trends help separate temporary fluctuations from long-term performance shifts, enabling faster and more confident decision-making.

**2️⃣ Profit Analysis Dashboard**

**What’s happening:**
This page focuses on profitability rather than just revenue. It highlights profit margin %, contribution %, and profit distribution across products, customers, and regions. It clearly shows cases where high revenue does not necessarily translate into high profit.

**Why it’s happening:**
Low margins can result from heavy discounting, high-cost products, inefficient pricing strategies, or regional cost differences. These issues often remain hidden when analysis is limited to revenue numbers alone.

**How the dashboard helps:**
By breaking down profit metrics visually, this dashboard helps identify low-margin customers or products that are dragging overall profitability. Stakeholders can use these insights to revise pricing, renegotiate contracts, focus on high-margin segments, or reduce dependency on unprofitable sales.

**3️⃣ Performance Insights Dashboard**

**What’s happening:**
This page compares top and bottom performers across regions, customers, and products. It highlights performance gaps, declining segments, and consistently strong contributors.

**Why it’s happening:**
Uneven sales execution, market maturity differences, and varying customer behavior lead to performance imbalance. Without comparison views, underperformance often goes unnoticed until revenue is impacted.

**How the dashboard helps:**
The Performance Insights page enables targeted action. Sales teams can replicate best practices from top-performing regions and intervene early in declining segments. Leadership can allocate resources more effectively based on data-backed evidence.
